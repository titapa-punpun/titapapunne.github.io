<h1>About Me</h1>

<body>
	<p>Hi! I'm currently a sophomore at Tufts University potentially majoring in Computer Science and Economics. Home to me is Bangkok, Thailand, but I've also found home here at Tufts. Here, I'm a member of the Badminton Club, an analyst in Tufts Consulting Collective, and an all-time snacker. This past summer, I interned at DBS Vickers Securities while also picking up a bit of Muay Thai (Thai Boxing)!</p>
